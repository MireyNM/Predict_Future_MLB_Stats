# Predicting Base Stealing Success in MLB with Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the number of stolen bases in Major League Baseball (MLB) in 2023 and the time it takes for a runner to reach second or third base using machine learning models.

## Data Collection
Data was collected from various sources such as baseball statistics databases, team websites, and MLB.com, using tools such as BeautifulSoup. The data includes runner's running speed, pitcher's average pitch speed, catcher's pop time, lead off distance, and the time it takes for the catcher to throw the ball.

## Data Analysis
Data was analyzed to gain a better understanding of its characteristics and identify any patterns or trends through summarization, visualization, and checking for missing or incomplete data.

## Model Development
The data was used to train and evaluate three machine learning models:

- ARIMA model to predict the number of stolen bases in 2023
- Linear regression model to predict the time it takes for a runner to reach second or third base based on lead off distance and their known running times, as well as a - linear regression model to predict the time it takes for the catcher to throw the ball.

## Technologies and Tools
The following technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms were used in this project:

Languages: Python<br>
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code<br>
Mathamatical algorithms: interpolation<br>
Machine learning libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, pybaseball, BeautifulSoup<br>
Machine learning algorithms: ARIMA, linear regression

## Conclusion
This project developed three machine learning models to predict the number of stolen bases in MLB in 2023 and the time it takes for a runner to reach second or third base. The models use various inputs including runner's running speed, pitcher's average pitch speed, catcher's pop time, lead off distance, and catcher's throw time. The results of these models could be useful for coaching and strategy decisions during games and for analyzing player performance.
