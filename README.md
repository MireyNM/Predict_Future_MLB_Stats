#Predicting Base Stealing Success in MLB with Machine Learning

##Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a Major League Baseball (MLB) runner will successfully steal 2nd or 3rd base. This model will use the runner's running speed, the pitcher's average pitch speed, and the catcher's pop time as inputs. The results of this model could be useful for coaching and strategy decisions during games and for analyzing player performance.

##Data Collection
The data for this project will include statistics and information about MLB runners, pitchers, and catchers. This includes running speed, pitch speed, pop time, and other relevant factors that could impact a runner's ability to steal a base. The data will be collected from various sources, such as baseball statistics databases and team websites.

##Data Analysis
The data will be analyzed to gain a better understanding of its characteristics and identify any patterns or trends. This will involve summarizing the data, creating visualizations, and finding any missing or incomplete data.

##Model Development
The collected data will be used to train and evaluate the machine learning model. The data will be split into training and test sets, and various models and algorithms will be selected and tuned. Evaluation metrics will be used to assess the model's performance. The most important features for predicting base stealing success will be identified through feature engineering techniques.

##Technologies and Tools
The following technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms will be used in this project:

##Languages: Python, R
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, R Studio
Machine learning libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, pybaseball
Machine learning algorithms: linear regression, ARIMA

##Conclusion
A machine learning model was developed to predict the success of base stealing in MLB. The model uses the runner's running speed, the pitcher's average pitch speed, and the catcher's pop time as inputs. The data was collected from various sources and analyzed to identify patterns and trends. The model was developed using various machine learning algorithms and technologies, including linear regression, ARIMA, and the python library pybaseball.
