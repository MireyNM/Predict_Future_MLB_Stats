Factors that can affect a player's ability to steal a base:

Runner-

Speed: A runner's speed plays a crucial role in his ability to steal a base. A faster runner will have an easier time stealing a base than a slower runner.
Lead off distance: The distance the runner starts from his base before the pitcher throws the ball, the bigger the lead off, the better the chance to reach next base.
Jump: A runner's ability to get a quick start and "jump" off the base can also play a role in a successful steal.
Pitcher-

Delivery time: The pitcher's delivery time to home plate can affect the ability of the runner to steal a base. Faster deliveries makes it more difficult for the runner to get a good jump.
Catcher-

Pop time: The time it takes for the catcher to release the ball after receiving it from the pitcher can play a role in a successful steal.
Arm strength: A catcher with a strong arm will make it more difficult for the runner to reach the next base.
